# violation_tracker

This is a Python file that download records from Violation Tracker Database.

"Violation Tracker, produced by the Corporate Research Project of Good Jobs First, brings together enforcement data obtained from more than 400 federal, state and local regulatory agencies with responsibility for banking, consumer protection, environmental, wage & hour, unfair labor practice, health and safety, workplace discrimination and other matters. We also collect information from the Justice Department on cases referred to it by these agencies as well as cases it initiated on offenses such as price-fixing, foreign bribery, false claims, civil rights abuses and tax evasion."

"The basic violation data was obtained from the websites of the federal agencies, the Justice Department and the state attorneys general. In some cases the data for a particular agency could be downloaded all at once. In other cases we had to “scrape” the information from website tables or extract the information from official press releases posted on those sites. In all cases we initially gathered data going back to the beginning of 2010, and in September 2017 we extended the coverage back to the beginning of 2000. Much of the data for that ten-year expansion came from online sources but for some agencies we needed to supplement that with Freedom of Information Act requests. The litigation data comes mainly from federal and state court dockets. "
